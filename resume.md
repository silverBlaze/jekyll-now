<p class="space-bottom"><b>WCF Service-oriented Architecture (2017 - 2018)</b> Innovator and lead developer for a set of enterprise-level WCF services that encapsulated complex integrations and reusable functionality. Allowed internal applications to easily integrate with external client and vendor APIs, regardless of standards or compatibility. Also replaced redundant code and GAC assemblies which were difficult to maintain across multiple servers due to complex machine configurations and dependencies. <i>C#, WCF, JSON, SOAP, Entity Framework, ADO.NET, MSMQ, Postman, SoapUI, Groovy</i></p>
<p class="space-bottom"><b>Multi-Payment Transaction UI Component (2017)</b> Designer and developer of a complex, reusable MVC component allowing multiple payments to be entered within one transaction.
