I'm a senior software architect and developer with 15 years professional IT experience, including a decade in professional software design and development in the payment processing and banking sector. My areas of expertise include full-stack .NET development, Agile methodologies, n-tier architecture, FinTech, and complex distributed system integrations.

IT and network security have always been a hobby of mine, so I try to keep up with the latest hacking news. In my free time I like to read, write, play old video games, and tinker with microcontrollers.
