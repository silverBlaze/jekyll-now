I am super late to the party on static-site generators. I just discovered Jekyll a few months ago, and am only now getting around to actually trying it out. Thanks to the great open source project [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), it was easy to fork something premade and add a few personal touches to make it my own.

If you aren't familiar with static-site generators, the idea is that a static HTML website is generated from a set of source files. Using Jekyll, you can effectively create a blog, and you can just add a new text file to the _posts folder to create a new article. Jekyll is a bit of a pain to get installed in Windows (but is actually possible without Linux, thanks to the Windows 10 update allowing you to install an Ubuntu subsystem, letting you run Bash on Windows. See [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/) to learn more.)

GitHub provides free static site hosting for anyone, including one personal site per user. Since they also support Jekyll inherently, you don't even need even need to compile the source files with Jekyll locally before pushing it out to GitHub. Since GitHub Pages hosts the site out of one of your repositories, this site is entirely [open source](https://github.com/silverBlaze/silverblaze.github.io/tree/master). To make changes to the site, I simply make changes to my local cloned copy, commit the changes, and push the new master branch to GitHub. This [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) goes into a lot of detail on how to host your own personal site on GitHub.

GitHub even supports using your own custom domain at no cost. I was able to use my [wells.solutions](http://wells.solutions) domain since my DNS host allows me to create ANAME records. For more info on using a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site, see their [help page](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/).

As I already mentioned, I forked the project [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to start, which is a great boilerplate project to get started. The README in that project has a great Quick Start guide. If you aren't trying to compile and preview your site locally, you can even avoid installing Jekyll on your workstation if you fork this project. It is a great alternative to starting from scratch.
