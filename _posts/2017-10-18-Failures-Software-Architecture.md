Software architecture is never an exact science. In reality, it's mostly subjective and heavily influenced by whatever patterns or frameworks the architect knows best. Even worse, many teams pick an architecture based purely on trends and buzz words.

I liked [Alex Hudson's recent post](https://www.alexhudson.com/2017/10/14/software-architecture-failing/) taking down some modern architectures being used as "silver bullets" without consideration of a team's actual problems.<!--more--> Architecture doesn't replace the need for an actual technical strategy. As Hudson puts it, "architecture is only 'good' in the context of the problem it tries to solve."

Knowing the specific challenges your business is up against lets you consistently make the right decisions: build vs. buy, treating development as a last resort, rapidly delivering business value with small pieces of software, and (of course) choosing the right architecture.
