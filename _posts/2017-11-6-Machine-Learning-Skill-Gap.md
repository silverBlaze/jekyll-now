ServiceNow has published an interesting whitepaper investigating the rise of machine learning in 2017. In a survey of 500 CIOs from 11 countries, 41-percent of respondents said a lack of skills is a barrier to machine learning adoption; 47-percent cited a lack of budget for new skills.

This big of a skill gap cannot stay open for very long. As CIOs drive digital transformation and continue to realize the value from machine learning, it will continue to dominate the the spotlight.

ServiceNow's research shows that the "first movers" who are thinking ahead and spending on machine learning are prioritizing talent. As the rest of the market races to catch up, funding will inevitably rise to match the demand for these kinds of skills.

This kind of technical revolution marks a huge opportunity for enterprising developers to help close that gap by learning more about the data science methodologies necessary for a successful implementation. Software developers have a lot to gain by accepting machine learning into their world. As the whitepaper explains, "By automating routine tasks, machine learning will allow humans to do higher value work, and thus extend the capabilities of our workforce."

In lieu of specific training, developers can do more to remove other barriers to adoption, like finding ways to improve data quality. Getting involved early in the process will be the best way to stay relevant and have some say in how and where AI gets deployed in their organization.
