[ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) has published a report investigating the rise of machine learning in 2017, and identifying what is holding back organizations from reaping its benefits. In a survey of 500 CIOs from 11 countries, 41-percent of respondents said a lack of skills is a barrier to machine learning adoption; 47-percent cited a lack of budget for new skills.

This large of a skill gap cannot stay open for long. As CIOs drive their digital transformation and continue to see the tangible benefits of machine learning, it will continue to dominate the the spotlight. ServiceNow's research shows that "first movers" who are spending on machine learning are prioritizing talent. As the rest of the market races to catch up, funding will inevitably rise to match the demand for these kinds of skills; this means plenty of job openings for those with the right skill set.

This data science revolution marks a huge opportunity for enterprising developers that want to help close the skill gap by training in new methods and architectures necessary for a successful implementation. By mastering [one or more machine learning frameworks](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning), developers have a chance to use their critical thinking and problem-solving skills to solidify their future roles in a new working model.

Software developers also have a lot to gain by facilitating machine learning adoption. As the report explains, "By automating routine tasks, machine learning will allow humans to do higher value work, and thus extend the capabilities of our workforce." Such tools have potential to make it easier for developers to do their jobs by allowing them to focus on bigger picture problems.

Apart from mastering new machine learning platforms, developers can do more to remove other barriers to adoption (such as finding ways to improve data quality.) Getting involved early in the process will be the best way to stay relevant and have some say in how and where AI gets deployed in their organization.
